# Python DLL Fix for AirImputePro

## Problem
When running `AirImputePro.exe`, you get the error:
> "System Error: The code execution cannot proceed because python310.dll was not found. Reinstalling the program may fix this problem"

## Root Cause
The application uses PyO3 v0.20 which was compiled against Python 3.10, but the project bundles Python 3.11. Additionally, Windows security settings restrict DLL loading to system directories only, preventing the bundled Python DLL from being loaded.

## Comprehensive Solution Implemented

### 1. Code Fix (Permanent Solution)
Modified the application to properly handle DLL loading:
- Created `src-tauri/src/security/dll_security.rs` to manage secure DLL loading
- Updated `main.rs` to initialize DLL security before Python initialization
- Uses Windows `AddDllDirectory` API to add Python directory to secure search path
- Maintains security against DLL hijacking while allowing legitimate DLLs

### 2. Quick Fix Scripts
Three scripts are provided for immediate relief:

#### `enhanced-fix-python-dll.bat` (Simplest)
- Double-click to run
- Creates python310.dll from python311.dll
- Copies DLLs next to executable
- Checks Visual C++ Redistributable

#### `comprehensive-dll-fix.ps1` (Advanced)
PowerShell script with diagnostics and fixes:
```powershell
# Run diagnostics
.\comprehensive-dll-fix.ps1 -Diagnose

# Apply fixes
.\comprehensive-dll-fix.ps1 -Fix

# Rebuild application
.\comprehensive-dll-fix.ps1 -Rebuild
```

#### `fix-python-dll.bat` (Original)
Basic fix that copies python311.dll to python310.dll

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Immediate)
1. Run `enhanced-fix-python-dll.bat` as Administrator
2. Try running AirImputePro.exe

### Option 2: Rebuild with Fix (Permanent)
1. The code has been updated with proper DLL handling
2. Rebuild the application:
   ```bash
   npm run tauri:build:windows
   ```
3. The new build will properly load Python DLLs

### Option 3: Manual Fix
1. Locate `python311.dll` in `python-dist/` directory
2. Copy it and rename to `python310.dll`
3. Place both DLLs in the same directory as `AirImputePro.exe`

## Additional Requirements
- Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable (x64)
  - Download: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
- Windows 7 users need Windows Update KB2533623

## Technical Details
The fix works by:
1. Setting secure DLL directories to prevent hijacking
2. Adding the Python directory to the DLL search path using `AddDllDirectory`
3. Ensuring python310.dll exists (copied from python311.dll)
4. Bundling all required DLLs with the executable

## Troubleshooting
If the error persists:
1. Run PowerShell script with `-Diagnose` flag
2. Check Windows Event Viewer for detailed errors
3. Ensure Visual C++ Redistributable is installed
4. Try running as Administrator
5. Verify antivirus isn't blocking the DLLs

## Prevention
For future builds:
- The code fix ensures proper DLL loading
- Build script creates python310.dll automatically
- Resources are properly bundled in Tauri configuration
