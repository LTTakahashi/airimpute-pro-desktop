## Migration Guide

### From R (mice/Amelia)
```r
# R (mice)
library(mice)
imputed <- mice(data, m=5, method='pmm')

# Equivalent in AirImpute Pro
# GUI: Select PMM method with 5 imputations
# Or use Python API:
from airimpute import ImputationEngine
engine = ImputationEngine()
result = engine.impute(data, method='pmm', n_imputations=5)
```

### From Python (sklearn)
```python
# sklearn
from sklearn.impute import IterativeImputer
imputer = IterativeImputer(random_state=0)
imputed = imputer.fit_transform(data)

# AirImpute Pro (more options)
from airimpute.methods import MachineLearningImputer
imputer = MachineLearningImputer(method='iterative')
result = imputer.impute(data)  # Returns comprehensive results
```

### From MATLAB
```matlab
% MATLAB
fillmissing(data, 'linear')

% AirImpute Pro offers more control
# Python API
from airimpute.methods import InterpolationImputer
imputer = InterpolationImputer(method='linear', limit_direction='both')
result = imputer.impute(data)
```
