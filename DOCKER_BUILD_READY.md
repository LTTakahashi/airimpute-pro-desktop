# Docker Windows Build - Ready to Run!

## What We've Fixed

### 1. **User-Centric Rust Installation** ✅
- Created `Dockerfile.windows-build-v2` implementing Gemini's recommendations
- Rust is now installed as the `builder` user, not root
- Environment variables set BEFORE user switch
- This fixes the "rustup could not choose a version" error

### 2. **Build Script Updates** ✅
- Updated `build-windows-secure-v3.sh` to work with pre-configured Docker environment
- Fixed Python SHA256 hash (was wrong, now correct)
- Removed unnecessary Rust configuration steps for Docker

### 3. **Docker Wrapper Script** ✅
- `build-windows-docker-sudo.sh` updated to use new Dockerfile v2
- Handles sudo requirements automatically
- Creates proper cache directories with correct permissions

## Quick Start

### 1. Start Docker (if not running)
```bash
# Fix Docker iptables issues in WSL2 and start daemon
sudo ./fix-docker-iptables.sh

# OR manually start Docker
sudo service docker start
```

### 2. Run the Build
```bash
# This will build Docker image and compile Windows executable
./build-windows-docker-sudo.sh
```

## What Will Happen

1. **Docker Image Build** (~5-10 minutes)
   - Downloads Debian base image
   - Installs Zig with SHA256 verification
   - Creates builder user
   - Installs Rust toolchain as builder user
   - Adds Windows MSVC target
   - Installs cargo-zigbuild

2. **Windows Cross-Compilation** (~10-15 minutes)
   - Downloads Python bundle for Windows
   - Builds frontend with npm
   - Cross-compiles Rust code to Windows
   - Creates NSIS installer

3. **Output Files**
   - `dist/windows/airimpute-pro.exe` - Standalone executable
   - `dist/windows/AirImpute-Pro_1.0.0_x64-setup.exe` - Windows installer

## Key Improvements

### Security
- Non-root build process
- SHA256 verification for all downloads
- Restrictive umask settings
- Isolated build environment

### Reliability
- Fixed Rust toolchain accessibility
- Proper environment variable ordering
- User-owned cache directories
- Atomic Docker builds

### Performance
- Cached dependencies between builds
- Parallel installation steps
- Minimal Docker image size

## Troubleshooting

### If Docker won't start
```bash
# Check WSL version
wsl --version

# Try the iptables fix
sudo ./fix-docker-iptables.sh
```

### If build fails
```bash
# Run the test script
./test-docker-build.sh

# Check build logs
cat build-windows/build-*.log
```

### To clean and retry
```bash
# Remove old Docker images
sudo docker rmi airimpute-windows-builder:v1.0.0 || true
sudo docker rmi airimpute-windows-builder:v2.0.0 || true

# Clean build directory
rm -rf build-windows dist/windows

# Run build again
./build-windows-docker-sudo.sh
```

## Technical Details

### Why User-Centric Installation?
The previous Dockerfile installed Rust as root, then switched to a non-root user. This caused Rust to be inaccessible because:
1. CARGO_HOME and RUSTUP_HOME were set after the user switch
2. The builder user couldn't access root-owned Rust files
3. rustup couldn't find the toolchain configuration

### The Fix
1. Create builder user first
2. Set environment variables
3. Switch to builder user
4. Install Rust as builder user
5. All files are owned by builder, accessible during build

This approach ensures the build process has full access to the Rust toolchain while maintaining security through non-root execution.

## Ready to Build!
Everything is configured and ready. Just start Docker and run the build script!
