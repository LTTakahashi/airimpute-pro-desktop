# RAH (Robust Adaptive Hybrid) Implementation Summary

## ðŸš€ Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Components

#### 1. **Core RAH Method** (`scripts/airimpute/methods/rah.py`)
- Full RAH implementation with pattern analysis and adaptive method selection
- **Key Features:**
  - PatternAnalyzer: Comprehensive analysis of temporal, spatial, and statistical patterns
  - AdaptiveMethodSelector: Intelligent method selection based on local context
  - LocalContext analysis: Evaluates gap size, variance, trends, periodicity, noise
  - Performance tracking and adaptive learning

#### 2. **Component Methods**
- **Base Methods:** Mean, Forward Fill, Backward Fill
- **Interpolation:** Linear, Spline (with configurable order)
- **Statistical:** Kalman Filter
- **Machine Learning:** Random Forest, KNN, Matrix Factorization
- **Advanced:** Local Linear, Pattern-Based imputation
- **Deep Learning:** Placeholder for neural network methods

#### 3. **Pattern Analysis Features**
- **Temporal Analysis:**
  - Autocorrelation and periodicity detection
  - Trend detection (linear/nonlinear/stationary)
  - Seasonality strength calculation
  - Stationarity testing
  
- **Spatial Analysis:**
  - Cross-correlation between variables
  - Mutual information (placeholder)
  - Distance matrix calculations
  
- **Missing Data Structure:**
  - Gap length distribution
  - Burst tendency analysis
  - Pattern classification (Random, Temporal, Burst, Periodic, Monotonic, Mixed)
  
- **Statistical Properties:**
  - Noise level estimation
  - Outlier detection
  - Distribution characteristics (skewness, kurtosis)

#### 4. **Adaptive Method Selection**
- **Context-Aware Weighting:**
  - Small gaps (â‰¤3): Prefer interpolation methods
  - Medium gaps (â‰¤10): Balanced approach with Kalman and Spline
  - Large gaps (>10): Conservative approach with mean and fill methods
  
- **Dynamic Adjustments Based On:**
  - Local variance (high variance reduces interpolation weight)
  - Trend strength (strong trends favor linear/Kalman)
  - Periodicity (periodic patterns favor Kalman/Spline)
  - Noise level (high noise favors robust methods)
  - Pattern type (burst patterns favor fill methods)

#### 5. **Integration with Core Engine**
- All methods registered in `ImputationEngine`
- Support for uncertainty quantification
- Ensemble capabilities
- Performance tracking and caching
