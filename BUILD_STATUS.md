# Build Status Summary

## Current Status

### ✅ Frontend Build
- TypeScript/React frontend builds successfully
- All TypeScript errors have been fixed
- Build output: `pnpm build` completes without errors

### ✅ Backend Build (Rust/Tauri)
- **FIXED**: Python linking issue resolved using virtual environment
- Backend now compiles successfully with `cargo build`
- Solution: Created Python virtual environment which pyo3 detects automatically

### ✅ Security Validation
- Python bridge security tests pass
- Whitelist validation working correctly
- Path traversal prevention implemented

## Issues Identified

### 1. Python Linking (P0 - Critical) ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: The system's `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/python-3.12.pc` was missing the `Libs:` section, causing pyo3 to fail during linking.

**Solution**: Created Python virtual environment (`.venv`) which pyo3 automatically detects and uses for proper linking.
```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
cargo build  # Now works!
```

### 2. WebKit Dependencies (P1 - High)
**Problem**: Integration tests require webkit2gtk-4.0 but system has 4.1

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. ✅ Created standalone security validation tests
2. ✅ Created Docker container configuration for proper environment
3. ⏳ Need to use container for full integration testing

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action
1. **For Development**: Use the Docker container defined in `.devcontainer/`
   ```bash
   # Build and run in container
   docker build -f .devcontainer/Dockerfile -t airimpute-dev .
   docker run -it -v $(pwd):/workspace airimpute-dev
   ```

2. **For Testing**: Run security validation tests that don't require full build
   ```bash
   ./tests/test_python_bridge_security.sh
   ```

### Long-term Solution
1. Migrate all development to containerized environment
2. Update CI/CD to use the same container
3. Document all system dependencies clearly

## Current Blockers

### libsoup2/libsoup3 Conflict (P0 - Critical)
**Problem**: When running tests, getting error: "libsoup3 symbols detected. Using libsoup2 and libsoup3 in the same process is not supported."

**Status**: Working on resolution using bundled libraries approach

## Working Components

✅ Frontend application (React/TypeScript)
✅ Rust backend compilation (with Python venv)
✅ Python bridge security validation
✅ Docker container configuration
✅ Build scripts and tooling

## Partially Working

⚠️ Unit tests (blocked by libsoup conflict)
⚠️ Full integration tests (WebKit version + libsoup)
⚠️ Desktop application packaging

## Summary

Major progress achieved:
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully
- ✅ Backend now compiles with Python virtual environment
- ✅ Security validation tests pass

Remaining issue:
- ❌ libsoup2/libsoup3 conflict prevents running unit tests
- Recommended solution: Use Docker container for consistent test environment
