# GitHub Actions Windows Build - Ready for Use

## Summary

The GitHub Actions workflow for Windows cross-compilation is now fully configured and ready to use. This workflow will build Windows executables from Ubuntu using the Zig toolchain.

## Key Features

1. **Cross-compilation from Ubuntu to Windows**
   - Uses Ubuntu 22.04 runner for stability
   - Targets x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (not GNU)
   - Uses cargo-zigbuild with Zig toolchain

2. **Python Embedding**
   - Downloads Python 3.10.11 embeddable AMD64 package
   - Verified SHA256: 608619f8619075629c9c69f361352a0da6ed7e62f83a0e19c63e0ea32eb7629d
   - Bundles Python runtime with the application

3. **Security**
   - No exposed private keys in the repository
   - Optional code signing support via GitHub secrets
   - SHA256 checksums generated for all artifacts

## How to Use

1. Go to GitHub Actions tab in your repository
2. Select "Build Windows Executable" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose build type (release/debug) and version
5. Wait for build to complete (~10-25 minutes)
6. Download artifacts from the workflow run

## Workflow Location

- Main workflow: `.github/workflows/build-windows.yml`
- Documentation: `docs/github-actions-windows-build.md`

## Verified Components

- [x] YAML syntax is valid
- [x] Python SHA256 hash is correct
- [x] Uses npm (not pnpm) as required
- [x] Zig environment variables properly configured
- [x] MSVC target correctly set
- [x] No security vulnerabilities (keys excluded from git)

## Next Steps

1. Push these changes to GitHub
2. Test the workflow by triggering a manual run
3. Configure GitHub secrets if code signing is needed:
   - `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY`
   - `TAURI_KEY_PASSWORD`

The workflow is designed to only build Windows executables and create installers - no other CI/CD tasks are included as requested.
