# Integration Test Strategy for AirImpute Pro Desktop

## Current Status

### WebKit Dependency Issue
- **Problem**: Integration tests require webkit2gtk-4.0 but WSL2 environment has 4.1 installed
- **Root Cause**: Tauri dependencies are locked to WebKit 4.0, creating a version mismatch
- **Impact**: Cannot run full integration tests that require Tauri runtime

### Temporary Workarounds Attempted
1. **pkg-config redirect** - Failed: Linker directly looks for .so files
2. **User-space symlinks** - Partially successful but risky due to potential ABI incompatibility
3. **Minimal tests without WebKit** - Successful for validation logic only

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Security Validation Tests (‚úÖ Implemented)
Created standalone test script that validates Python bridge security without WebKit:
```bash
./tests/test_python_bridge_security.sh
```

This tests:
- Path traversal prevention
- Dangerous module blocking
- Function whitelist enforcement
- Operation validation logic

### 2. Docker Container Environment (üöß In Progress)
Created `.devcontainer/` configuration for consistent test environment:
- Ubuntu 22.04 base with webkit2gtk-4.0-dev
- Proper dependency versions matching Tauri requirements
- VS Code dev container support for collaborative development

## Long-term Strategy

### Phase 1: Containerization (Priority: P0)
1. Complete Docker container setup with all dependencies
2. Verify container builds and runs tests successfully
3. Document container usage for all developers

### Phase 2: CI/CD Integration
1. Use Docker container in GitHub Actions
2. Run full test suite on every PR
3. Include security validation, unit tests, and integration tests

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Test Coverage
1. Expand integration tests for all Tauri commands
2. Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows
3. Implement performance benchmarks

## Security Testing Requirements

### Static Analysis
- `cargo audit` for Rust dependencies
- `pip-audit` for Python dependencies
- License compliance checks

### Dynamic Testing
- Fuzz testing for Python bridge inputs
- Context isolation verification
- Authorization boundary testing

### Pre-commit Checklist
1. Run security validation tests
2. Check for TypeScript/ESLint errors
3. Run Rust clippy for warnings
4. Verify all tests pass in container

## Action Items
1. ‚úÖ Create security validation tests
2. üöß Complete Docker container setup
3. ‚è≥ Migrate all tests to container environment
4. ‚è≥ Set up CI/CD pipeline with container
5. ‚è≥ Expand test coverage systematically

## Notes
- WebKit 4.0 vs 4.1 ABI compatibility is not guaranteed
- Container approach ensures reproducible test environment
- Security tests must run before any production deployment
